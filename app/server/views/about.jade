							CTF stands for <b>Capture the Flag</b>. Aside from being a popular physical activity, CTF also refers to a type of computer security competition in which certain pieces of information, called "flags", are placed on servers, encrypted, hidden, or otherwise stored somewhere difficult to access, and the participants try to reverse-engineer, break, hack, decrypt, or anything to capture that flag. When a team submits this flag to a scoring page, they will get points. The challenges are all set up with the intent of being hacked, making it an excellent, legal way to get hands on experience.
