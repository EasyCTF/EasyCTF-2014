								| &nbsp;&nbsp;What are we hacking? Is this legal?<br />
							| Nooooo we're not hacking banks and stealing credit cards like you might see in those Hollywood movies. In fact, we're trying to destroy that stereotype and create an entirely different one here, even though some challenges may ask you to "hack" into different things by utilizing vulnerabilities.
