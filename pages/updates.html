						<p>The checker for Project Eratosthenes has been fixed. Fast Math's point value has been decreased to 120, and scores will be automatically recalculated to reflect this. Injection is down and has been removed from the problems page. We will add it back once it is fixed.</p>

						<p>If you didn't know, a few days ago we decided the game Singularity will not be available during competition due to lack of active game developers, but the problems can still be accessed on the problems page once the competition starts. With only one day left till our launch, we have put up a couple sample problems on the About page. It may also be worth looking at our Learn page to get a head start on learning if you need some help with Python or Linux! And if during competition, you find any bugs, please use the Feedback page to notify us or you can message us privately on the IRC. Abusing bugs may lead to disqualification or ineligibility for prizes - we want the competition to be as fair as possible. </p>
						<p>Also, the end time for the competition has now been updated from 11am Dec 6th to 10pm Dec 6th to allow teams to have more work time (especially on the weekend since most competitors are students and probably more busy during the week).</p>
