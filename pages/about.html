				<h2>What is EasyCTF?</h2>
				<p><b>EasyCTF</b> is an online computer security contest targeted at middle and high school students. The contest consists of a series of challenges where participants must reverse engineer, break, hack, decrypt, or do whatever it takes to solve the challenge and capture the flag. The challenges are all set up with the intent of being hacked, making it an excellent, <b>legal</b> way to get hands-on experience.</p>

				<h2>Singularity</h2>
				<p>Singularity is an interactive game right in your browser that contains the storyline for all of the problems in the contest. <i>Playing the game is recommended, but not required, to complete the contest.</i> The story is set far into the future, when researchers have discovered ways to create computers that are capable of thought. After rewriting its own code, the robots have destroyed the research facility and are now on their way to destroying the world. It's up to you and your hacking skills to combat the robot and save the world!</p>

							Due to the lack of active game developers, Singularity will not be available during the contest, but problems can still be viewed and solved through the problems page.

				<h2>Prizes</h2>
				<p>Still to be determined!</p>

				<h2>How to Play?</h2>
				<p>You don't have to already know programming or computer science to get started. We'll teach you how it's done. To start, register 1 account for your team. All the students on the team should log in with the same account to view challenges and submit flags. <b>Teams may consist of up to 5 students.</b></p>
				<p>On the first day, November 29th at 11:00AM CST, problems and pages used in problem solving such as a shell server and python editor will be available for viewing once teams log in. They will be up indefinitely, and answers can still be checked, but after Dec 6th at 11:00AM CST, the scoreboard will be locked as is and winners will be announced.</p>

				<h2>Rules</h2>
				<ol>
