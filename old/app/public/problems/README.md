# `PROBLEMS` Directory

Put important files that will be needed for the challenges in this folder.

## Guidelines

1. **Stay organized.** Put the files in folders rather than scattered all over the place.

## Usage

This folder is available under `/problems`. For example, if you put an `image.jpg` in a `problem-1` folder in this folder, that image can be accessed using `/problems/problem-1/image.jpg`.
